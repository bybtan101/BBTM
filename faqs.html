											<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
											<h3>Questions from potential students</h3>
												<p>Here at Acceltech, we value transparency and visibility. We understand it may be difficult for students to determine if this course is for them. To assist students in making their decision we have included a
												list of frequently asked questions from our students. We hope this helps students in determining if this course is the right fit for them.</p>

													<h2>Top Questions From Students</h2>
														<dl class="accordion">
															<dt class="accordion-trigger"><a href="#" title="show more">How technical is this course?</a></dt>
															<dd class="accordion-content">This course is designed for entry-level non-computer science students so our instructor will teach you all essential technical skills for this course from scratch. However, we do 
															expect hard work and our instructor will cover quite a bit during the 8 weeks</dd>
															<dt class="accordion-trigger"><a href="#" title="show more">What methods of payments do you guys accept?</a></dt>
															<dd class="accordion-content">Upon registering either online or via MISA, we do require a $50 dollar deposit, which can be paid for in our registration page. In the first week of class, we would need the remaining
															payments by either cheque or cash. We will provide a full receipt upon the clearing of the cheques.</dd>
															<dt class="accordion-trigger"><a href="#" title="show more">Where is this course taught at?</a></dt>
															<dd class="accordion-content">This course will be taught within SFU's Harbour centre in downtown. The actual instructions will be provided in an email upon registering and another email a week before the first day of class.</dd>
															<dt class="accordion-trigger"><a href="#" title="show more">Who is the instructor? What is his profile?</a></dt>
															<dd class="accordion-content">The current instructor for this course is Daruvin Sood, he has a BSC in computer engineering and physics at UBC. He also worked for huge corporations such as Microsoft, TELUS, and the
															Federal Government. He is currently a solutions architect at TELUS. He also has over 4 years of mentoring and teaching high-school and university students.</dd>
															<dt class="accordion-trigger"><a href="#" title="show more">How is this different than other training courses/bootcamps?</a></dt>
															<dd class="accordion-content">The main difference we see between this course and bootcamps are the level of technical knowledge it requires to go through those programs,
															They tends to be much more technical and focuses on purely on the deployment portion. However,
															our course focuses on the fundamentals of working on IT projects in various roles, which is wider in scope but not as in-depth as some of the other programs offered outside. 
															Essentially, we want our students to be able to put on multiple hats in the IT industry so providing knowledge in the areas
															of database management, developing, testing, and project management is better (we believe).</dd>
